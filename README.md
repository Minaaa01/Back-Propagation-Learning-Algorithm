# Back-Propagation-Learning-Algorithm
on a multi-layer neural networks, which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.
We use the penguins data in both training and testing processes.
(Each class has 50 samples: train NN with the first 30 non-repeated samples, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)
